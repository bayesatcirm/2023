Monday,8:45-9:00,Introduction,,,
Monday,9:00-11:00,Master Class,Nicolas Chopin,"An introduction to state-space models, particle filters, and Sequential Monte Carlo samplers"," This course will provide a general introduction to SMC algorithms, from basic particle filters and their uses in state-space (hidden Markov) modelling in various areas, to more advanced algorithms such as SMC samplers, which may be used to sample from one, or several target distributions. The course will cover ""a bit of everything"": theory (using Feynman-Kac models as a general framework), methodology (how to construct better algorithms in practice), implementation (examples in Python based on the library particles will be showcased), and applications."

Tuesday,14:00-15:00,Invited talk,Marta Catalano,Merging rate of opinions via optimal transport on random measures,"The Bayesian approach to inference is based on a coherent probabilistic framework that naturally leads to principled uncertainty quantification and prediction. Via posterior distributions, Bayesian nonparametric models make inference on parameters belonging to infinite-dimensional spaces, such as the space of probability distributions. The development of Bayesian nonparametrics has been triggered by the Dirichlet process, a nonparametric prior that allows one to learn the law of the observations through closed-form expressions. Still, its learning mechanism is often too simplistic and many generalizations have been proposed to increase its flexibility, a popular one being the class of normalized completely random measures. Here we investigate a simple yet fundamental matter: will a different prior actually guarantee a different learning outcome? To this end, we develop a new distance between completely random measures based on optimal transport, which provides an original framework for quantifying the similarity between posterior distributions (merging of opinions). Our findings provide neat and interpretable insights on the impact of popular Bayesian nonparametric priors, avoiding the usual restrictive assumptions on the data-generating process. This is joint work with Hugo Lavenant."

Friday,11:30-12:30,Invited talk,Sophie Donnet,Using a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to find the mesoscale structure of a network ,"This work is motivated by the analysis of ecological interaction networks. Stochastic block models are widely used in this field to decipher the structure that underlies a network or that is shared by a collection of networks. Efficient algorithms based on variational approximations exist for frequentist inference and sometimes for Bayesian inference, but without statistical guaranties as for the resulting estimates. We propose to combine the variational estimation with a sequential Monte-Carlo algorithm to efficiently sample the posterior distribution and to perform model selection. "
